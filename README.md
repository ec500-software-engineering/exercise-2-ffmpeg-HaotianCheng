# Excercise 2 Video Conversion
Part 1:
  * After I run "Estimate.py", ffmpeg uses 76.4%CPU and 170.9MB memory. My Computer has 4 core. (img provided). Therefore, I assume my computer can run about 4 operations at a time.

Part 2:
  * Put videofiles that you want to convert in InputVideos folder and simply run "main.py". I built a thread pool which contains only 3 threads but work perfectly to get and process the mission in provided queue.
